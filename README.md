# my_4wheel_bot

I am going to use this basic 4wheel_bot to learn the major concpets in ROS like perception, tf, Navigation, localisation etc., and play on it.

With the help of slam_toolbox package we added the map frame. By running rosrun gmapping slam_gmapping we can get the messages in rviz from slam_gmapping.
