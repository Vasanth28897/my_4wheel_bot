# my_4wheel_bot

I am going to use this basic 4wheel_bot to learn the major concpets in ROS like perception, tf, Navigation, localisation etc., and play on it.


#issues
laser scan is moving when the bot is moving in rviz
bot sliding even tho its stopped
because of the inconvenience i can't generate map.
