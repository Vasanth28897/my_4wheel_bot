# my_4wheel_bot

I am going to use this basic 4wheel_bot to learn the major concpets in ROS like perception, tf, Navigation, localisation etc., and play on it.

With the help of slam_toolbox package we added the map frame. But there's an issue on generating map, there's this warning in RVIZ in map display, "No message received".
