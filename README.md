# my_4wheel_bot

I am going to use this basic 4wheel_bot to learn the major concpets in ROS like perception, tf, Navigation, localisation etc., and play on it.

By running rosrun gmapping slam_gmapping we can get the messages in rviz from slam_gmapping.

#issues
map is moving when the bot is moving in rviz
